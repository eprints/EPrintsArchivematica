# EPrints - Archivematica Integration

Digital Preservation through EPrints-Archivematica Integration - An EPrints export plugin for contents to be preserved with Archivematica

The EPrints-Archivematica integration proposal was first presented at Archivematica Camp and OR2018 in Bozeman.

# Summary

The following is a summary of the proposed workflow for EPrints-Archivematica integration:

* “Digital Preservation Export” batch script runs periodically that identifies new/updated items to
export and generates the exports in a directory structure optimized for [Archivematica transfers](https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/archivematica-1.7/user-manual/transfer/transfer/#transfer-checksums) described below.

* The export plugin will create a transfer for each eprint. Each transfer includes: 
	* A `documents` folder containing All uploaded digital files that are a part of the eprint
	* A `metadata` folder with Dublin Core metadata (in JSON format) and EPrints XML metadata
	* A `revisions` folder containing all EPrints-generated “revision” XML files
	* A `derivatives` folder containing any derivative access files that were generated by EPrints, such as thumbnail images, audio access files, video access files

Transfers are moved to a specified shared storage location.

* The following would be the structure of the documents folder:

* The following would be the structure of the derivatives folder:

`fileid-XXXXX -> folder# -> filename`

* Archivematica's [Automation Tools](https://github.com/artefactual/automation-tools) monitors shared storage for new bag, creates transfers/ingests in Archivematica according to a user-defined processing configuration, and then stores AIPs in archival storage.

This integration is currently in the technical specification phase.
